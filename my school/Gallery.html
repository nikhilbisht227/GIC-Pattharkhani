    <p>Rehabilitation of Abandoned Villages in Uttarakhand

        During a recent inspection of the central sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Uttarakhand, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan directed Army formations to assist in rehabilitating two villages: Nelang and Jadung. These villages were abandoned by residents during the 1962 Indo-China war, as they relocated to safer areas in Uttarkashi and nearby regions1.
        
        Key Points:
        
        Historical Context: Nelang and Jadung were evacuated during the 1962 war, making them the first settlements from the border.
        Challenges: Identifying the true heirs of the vacant land after over 60 years poses a significant challenge due to the passage of time and the death of many original landowners.
        Revitalization Efforts:
        Return of Villagers: Army units, along with ITBP personnel and civilian authorities, are facilitating the return of villagers to these abandoned villages.
        Commercial Activities: To sustain livelihoods, there’s a need to revitalize commercial activities within the villages.
        Tourism Opportunities: The Army is exploring tourism prospects by enhancing infrastructure. Clear skies and an altitude of 13,000 feet make stargazing a potential activity in the area.
        Jadh Festival: Efforts are underway to promote the Jadh festival in Jadhang village, along with plans to construct local temples.
        Transforming Villages: Once commercial activities thrive, these villages accessible from the renowned tourist destination of Harsil can become sought-after destinations for bikers and travelers1.
        The rehabilitation of these villages not only restores their vibrancy but also strengthens the border communities’ resilience.</p>
